## Breaking Changes

### 0.2.0 Breaking Changes

- **Execution Model**: Changed from bytecode VM to JavaScript transpilation
- **Import Syntax**: Updated to support JavaScript modules
- **Runtime**: Moved from custom VM to JavaScript engines
- **Build Process**: New compilation targets and output formats

### Migration Guide from 0.1.x to 0.2.x

1. **Update import statements** to use JavaScript module syntax
2. **Recompile all code** with the new transpiler
3. **Update deployment** to use Node.js or browser environments
4. **Review interop code** for new JavaScript integration patterns

## Security

### Security Considerations

- **Code Injection**: Transpiled code inherits JavaScript security model
- **Dependency Management**: Relies on npm security practices
- **Runtime Safety**: Type checking and validation at compilation time
- **Sandboxing**: Depends on JavaScript runtime sandboxing

### Security Updates

- All security vulnerabilities will be documented here
- Critical security fixes will be backported to supported versions
- Security advisories will be published through GitHub
